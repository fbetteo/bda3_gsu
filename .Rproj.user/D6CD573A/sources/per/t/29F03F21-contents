# Exercise 1)

probability: how likely is that a particular event will occur, bounded between 0 and 1.

probability mass: probability assigned to some discrete values of a distribution. How likely a set (1 or more) of possible values of a discrete variable distribution are.

probability density: probability assigned to continuous values of a distribution. How likely a range of possible values of a discrete variable distribution are.

probability mass function: function that assigns to each value x of the discrete distribution the corresponding probability.

probability density function: function that assigns to each value x of the continuous distribution the corresponding probability.

probability distribution: General concept including discrete and continuous variables. A function that returns the probability of occurrence for any value of the distribution.

discrete probability distribution: Probability distribution for a variable that can only take discrete values. 

continuous probability distribution: Probability distribution for a variable that take continuous values. 

cumulative distribution function (cdf): Function that returns for any value  the probability that an occurrence of the corresponding   random variable will have  a value equal or less to it.

likelihood: probability to see some value(s) of a random variable given some parameter that specifies it's distribution.

# Exercise 2)

## a)
```{r}
mu=0.2
sigma2= 0.01

shape1 = mu*(mu*(1-mu)/sigma2 - 1)
shape2 = shape1*(1-mu)/mu


x = seq(0,1, 0.01)
y = dbeta(x, shape1=shape1, shape2=shape2)
plot(x,y)
```
## b)
```{r}
x_r = rbeta(1000, shape1, shape2)
hist(x_r)

```
## c)
```{r}
print(mean(x_r))
print(var(x_r))
```

## d)
```{r}
quantile(x_r, probs=c(0.025, 0.975))
```
